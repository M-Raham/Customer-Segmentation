# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. The model helps businesses identify different customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessed customer dataset
- K-Means clustering for segmentation
- Data visualization for insights

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning & clustering)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data visualization)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the application:

```bash
python customer_segmentation.py
```

- The application will generate customer segmentation insights and display visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset consists of customer transaction data, including purchase amounts, frequency, and demographics.
- The data is preprocessed before applying **K-Means clustering** to group similar customers.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Implementation of advanced clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Integration with real-time customer data
- Improved visualization and insights
